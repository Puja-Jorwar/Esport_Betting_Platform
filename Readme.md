## Introduction

The **Esports Betting on Blockchain** project is a decentralized platform built using the **Aptos Blockchain** to enable users to place bets on esports tournament outcomes. By utilizing smart contracts, this project aims to create a transparent, secure, and trustless betting environment for esports enthusiasts. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and ensures that all betting transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making them immutable and verifiable.

The platform supports betting on different esports games, allowing users to place bets on team outcomes, track their betting history, and engage in the competitive world of esports betting while maintaining security and fairness.

## Vision

The vision of this project is to create a fully decentralized, transparent, and secure betting ecosystem for esports tournaments. Key objectives of the project include:
- Providing a trustless environment for users to place and track bets on esports tournaments.
- Using blockchain technology to ensure that all betting activities are transparent and verifiable.
- Giving users full control over their funds with the ability to withdraw earnings directly from the smart contract.
- Allowing for a wide range of esports games to be supported, making the platform versatile and appealing to a global audience.

Through this vision, the project aims to bridge the gap between traditional betting platforms and the emerging Web3 space, enhancing the user experience in esports betting.

## Future Goals

The future goals of the project include:
1. **Expanded Game Support**: Currently designed for a few popular games like CS:GO and League of Legends, but we plan to support more esports titles based on community feedback and demand.
2. **Advanced Betting Features**: Introducing more dynamic betting features, such as multi-team betting, score predictions, and live odds during matches.
3. **Decentralized Governance**: Implementing a decentralized governance model where users can vote on important decisions such as game additions, rules, and new features.
4. **Integration with Decentralized Oracles**: Using decentralized oracles for fetching real-time tournament results, ensuring accuracy and fairness in payouts.
5. **Mobile App Development**: Building a mobile app for users to place bets and track their favorite tournaments directly from their smartphones.
6. **Incentive and Reward System**: Introducing rewards for active participants in the ecosystem, including bonuses for frequent bettors or users who refer others.

These future goals aim to enhance the platform's features, expand its user base, and ensure continuous growth in the rapidly evolving esports betting space.

## Deployed Address of the Project

**Note**: The project has not yet been deployed due to ongoing development and testing of the smart contracts. We are currently testing the platform on the Aptos Testnet to ensure its security and functionality. The deployed address will be shared once the project has been successfully deployed to the mainnet.
